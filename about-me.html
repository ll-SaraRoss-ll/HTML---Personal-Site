<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Sara Ross Young, I graduated highschool from <a href="">School of Tomorrow</a>. 
    I was always interested in computer programs and the science behind it. I attended and graduated 
    from <a href="">Addis Ababa University</a> with a B.A degree in Computer Science. I created a
    <a href="">Roadmap to become a Junior Developer</a> to get me to where I am as a developer today 
    and I intend to help fellow computer science graduates and students with this roadmap. 
    I have created programs with HTML, CSS & JS. In the next 5 years, I look forward to becoming 
    a Senior Pro Developer and to be part of a great company. <br>
